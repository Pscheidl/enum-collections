## Pull Requests

1. Use Pull Requests
1. Document new features and changes : rustdoc, examples in doctests, README.
1. Use [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines). Scopes are optional.
1. Do not introduce any code, dependencies or anything else conflicting with project's [LICENSE](LICENSE). E.g. anything GNU GPL v3 licensed.

Tests can be run locally: `cargo test --all-features` runs **all** tests in the repository. Use `cargo bench` to run benchmarks.
